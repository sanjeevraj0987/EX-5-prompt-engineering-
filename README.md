## 🧠 Prompting Techniques Overview

### 1. Zero-shot Prompting

**Description:**  
The model is asked to perform a task without any prior examples.

**Use Case:**  
Used for defining concepts or initiating tasks from scratch.

**Example Scenario:**  
## **PROMPT:**
“Describe common signs of equipment failure based on temperature and vibration changes.”

## **AI Tools Response**

## **ChatGPT** 
Common signs of equipment failure often manifest as abnormal changes in temperature and vibration patterns. An increase in temperature beyond normal operating levels can indicate issues such as friction due to lack of lubrication, bearing wear, or electrical faults like overheating motors. Elevated vibration levels are typically early indicators of mechanical problems such as imbalance, misalignment, loose parts, or worn components. When temperature and vibration increase simultaneously, it often suggests compound issues, such as bearing failure or shaft misalignment causing heat due to excessive friction. Monitoring these parameters over time helps in detecting trends and triggering maintenance actions before actual breakdowns occur.

## **Sider** 
Equipment failure often manifests through certain signs in temperature and vibration data. An increase in temperature beyond normal operating ranges can indicate overheating, bearing issues, or lubrication problems. Similarly, abnormal vibration patterns—such as higher amplitude or unusual frequency components—may suggest misalignment, imbalance, or worn-out parts. Monitoring these indicators helps in early detection of potential failures, allowing for timely maintenance to prevent costly breakdowns.

### 📊 Equipment Log Analysis: Motor Failure Risk

This section demonstrates the step-by-step reasoning for predicting the risk of motor failure based on temperature and vibration data. By analyzing the temperature and vibration levels from previous logs, we can identify potential issues and forecast the likelihood of failure.

### 📝 Reasoning: Why Is This Motor at Risk?

#### 1. **Initial Observation:**
The motor's **temperature** and **vibration** readings are key indicators of its health. Both metrics, when elevated beyond normal operating levels, often suggest potential issues.

---

#### 2. **Temperature Analysis:**

- **Log 1:** Temperature = 90°C (High)  
- **Log 2:** Temperature = 72°C (Normal)  
- **Log 3:** Temperature = 85°C (Elevated)  
- **New Log (Log 4):** Temperature = 88°C (Elevated)

**Step 1:**  
The temperature of the motor is consistently above normal operating levels (usually between 60-75°C). In the new log, the temperature is 88°C, which is notably high.

**Step 2:**  
Overheating of a motor can cause issues such as insulation breakdown, excessive friction, and accelerated wear of internal components. High temperatures can also be indicative of problems like insufficient lubrication or overloading.

---

#### 3. **Vibration Analysis:**

- **Log 1:** Vibration = 7.8 mm/s (High)  
- **Log 2:** Vibration = 1.0 mm/s (Normal)  
- **Log 3:** Vibration = 6.5 mm/s (Elevated)  
- **New Log (Log 4):** Vibration = 7.0 mm/s (Elevated)

**Step 3:**  
Vibration readings above 5.0 mm/s often indicate mechanical problems, such as misalignment, imbalance, or bearing wear. In Log 4, the vibration level is 7.0 mm/s, which is similar to Log 1 and suggests that the motor may be experiencing abnormal mechanical stress.

**Step 4:**  
Elevated vibration can lead to further mechanical degradation. It could be due to worn-out bearings, misaligned components, or imbalance in the motor's rotor, which can cause internal damage and eventual motor failure.

---

#### 4. **Correlation between Temperature and Vibration:**

**Step 5:**  
The combination of high temperature and high vibration levels in Log 1 and Log 3 correlates with motor issues like bearing failure or motor degradation. In Log 4, both metrics are again elevated, indicating that the motor is under stress and is at risk of similar failures.

**Step 6:**  
Motors under such conditions often experience premature failure if not inspected and maintained promptly. The combination of high temperature (leading to overheating) and high vibration (indicating mechanical issues) suggests the motor is at risk of severe mechanical failure.

---

### 🛠️ **Recommendation:**
Immediate inspection and maintenance actions are recommended to prevent severe motor damage or complete failure. Monitoring temperature and vibration regularly can help detect and mitigate risks early.

### 📊 Equipment Log Analysis: Motor Failure Risk

This section demonstrates the step-by-step reasoning for predicting the risk of motor failure based on temperature and vibration data. By analyzing the temperature and vibration levels from previous logs, we can identify potential issues and forecast the likelihood of failure.

### 📝 Reasoning: Why Is This Motor at Risk?

#### 1. **Examine Temperature Data**
If the motor's temperature has risen significantly above its normal operating range (e.g., normally around 70°C, now exceeding 85°C), it indicates potential **overheating**. Overheating can degrade insulation, bearings, or lubrication, increasing the risk of motor failure.

#### 2. **Analyze Vibration Data**
An increase in vibration levels (e.g., from 0.6 mm/s to 1.2 mm/s) suggests **mechanical imbalance**, **misalignment**, or **bearing wear**. High vibration levels can lead to mechanical fatigue and eventual failure if left unchecked.

#### 3. **Correlate Both Indicators**
When both temperature and vibration levels are high simultaneously, it reinforces the diagnosis. Elevated temperature could be caused by increased friction from abnormal vibration, or vice versa. Both of these factors indicate that the motor is developing faults and is at risk of failure.

#### 4. **Assess Trend and Severity**
If both temperature and vibration metrics are trending upward over time, the risk is escalating. Sudden spikes in either metric can indicate immediate issues that need urgent attention to prevent a complete motor failure.

---

### 🛠️ **Recommendation:**
Immediate inspection and maintenance actions are recommended to prevent severe motor damage or complete failure. Monitoring temperature and vibration regularly can help detect and mitigate risks early.

- **Advantages:** Simple to implement, ensures that maintenance is performed regularly.
- **Disadvantages:** Can lead to unnecessary downtime if equipment is in good condition, or maintenance might be missed if the equipment fails between scheduled intervals.

#### **Schedule 2: Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM)**
- **Frequency:** Maintenance is performed based on specific indicators (e.g., temperature, vibration, pressure) that suggest wear or failure.
- **Advantages:** More efficient than TBM, as maintenance is only performed when necessary, reducing unnecessary downtime and costs.
- **Disadvantages:** Requires sophisticated monitoring systems and may not be effective if the indicators are not properly calibrated or detected.

#### **Schedule 3: Predictive Maintenance (PdM)**
- **Frequency:** Maintenance is performed based on data analytics, where machine health is continuously monitored to predict failure before it occurs.
- **Advantages:** Maximizes equipment uptime by preventing unexpected failures. Reduces unnecessary maintenance and overall operational costs.
- **Disadvantages:** Requires advanced monitoring and analytics infrastructure, and initial setup costs may be high.

### 📝 **Recommendation:**

After evaluating the three maintenance schedules, **Predictive Maintenance (PdM)** is the most efficient choice. PdM offers a proactive approach, reducing downtime by predicting failures before they occur. Although it requires an initial investment in sensors and data analytics, the long-term cost savings from avoiding unexpected failures and reducing unnecessary maintenance make it the most cost-effective and efficient option.
